# Semantic Kernel examples

A bunch of examples that use [Microsoft's Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/tree/main)

## Prerequisites

- Any computer that is able to run C# .NET 9
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed.
- A few models need to be downloaded:
    ```bash
    ollama pull gemma3:4b
    ollama pull minicpm-v
    ```

The examples are intended to demonstrate and experiment with the Semantic Kernel library. Hence the models are kept as lightwight as possible. Although 8GB of RAM is most likely the bare minimum.
